# address_manager

A mailing address validator and manager.

This is a learning project for picking up Django and MVC concepts. The product was (the foundations of) a system to bulk upload, validate, manage and view stats on mailing addresses. Unlikely to be resumed, as I've switched my focus to Laravel.
